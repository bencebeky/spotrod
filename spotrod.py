    Calculate integrated flux of a star if it is transited by a planet
    of radius p*R_star, at projected position (planetx, planety)
    measured in R_star units.
    Flux is normalized to out-of-transit flux.
    This algorithm works by integrating over concentric rings,
    the number of which is controlled by n. Use n=1000 for fair results.
    Planetx is the coordinate perpendicular to the transit chord
    normalized to stellar radius units, and planety is the one
    parallel to the transit chord, in a fashion such that it increases
    throughout the transit.
    We assume that the one-dimensional arrays spotx, spoty, spotradius
    and spotcontrast have the same length: the number of the spots.

    Input parameters:

    m             length of time series
    n             number of concentric rings
    k             number of spots
    planet[xy]    planetary center coordinates in stellar radii in sky-projected coordinate system [m]
    z             planetary center distance from stellar disk center in stellar radii     (cached) [m]
    p             planetary radius in stellar radii, scalar
    r             radii of integration annuli in stellar radii, non-decreasing            (cached) [n]
    f             2.0 * limb darkening at r[i] * width of annulus i                       (cached) [n]
    spotx, spoty  spot center coordinates in stellar radii in sky-projected coordinate system      [k]
    spotradius    spot radius in stellar radii [k]
    spotcontrast  spot contrast [k]
    planetangle   value of [circleangle(r, p, z[i]) for i in range(m)]                 (cached) [m,n]

    (cached) means the parameter is redundant, and could be calculated from
    other parameters, but storing it and passing it to this routine speeds up
    iterative execution (fit or MCMC). Note that we do not take limb darkening
    coefficients, all we need is f.
